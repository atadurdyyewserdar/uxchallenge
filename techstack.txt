The stack we use:

Backend: Spring Framework (we use Kotlin, but it’s perfectly fine if you know Java and are open to learning Kotlin).
Frontend (optional): Vue.js, but experience with React or Angular is also relevant.
Deployment: Heroku for hosting our main application.
Infrastructure: DigitalOcean for external services like our Keycloak authentication server and Caddy reverse proxies.
Third-party integrations: AWS S3 for image storage and Stripe for payments.
